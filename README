Instructions for using Google bot:

1. Fill out the 'Search Term' parameter on the 'Form' worksheet
2. Next to 'Hits', enter the number of times you want the app to search for the given search phrase
3. Open Internet Explorer and search for the term you just put down as the parameter
4. On the initial search results page, count the number of times you need to press the 'Tab' button 
to get to the results list.  Then count the number of down arrows you have to press to get to the desired link.  
If your desired webpage is not on the 1st page of search results, count the number of down arrows you have to 
press to get to the page number link on the bottom of the first page.  Click on the page number link. 
Once the page loads, count the number of down arrows you have to press to get to your desired link.
5. Fill in the form with the numbers you just counted
6. The app can be programmed to hit up to 3 different links.  Fill out the parameters under 'Link 2' 
and 'Link 3' if you have more than 1 webpage you want to target.
7. See the 'Log' worksheet to view the stats of where, when, and how webpages were visited by the bot.  
Depending on your search term, the number of visits required to change rankings may vary.  Since Google 
operates on a distributed platform, changes usually take about 2 weeks to permanetly settle into the system.
